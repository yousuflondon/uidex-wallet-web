# Repository Guidelines for Agents

This repository is a Flutter project. The environment has all Dart and Flutter dependencies pre-fetched during setup, but network access is disabled afterwards. Use the commands below to work with the project.

## Setup

```bash
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
```

If the above fails due to the offline environment, add the `--offline` flag.

## Static Analysis and Formatting

Run analysis and formatting (only on changed files) before committing code:

```bash
flutter analyze

dart format [files]

```

## Running Tests

Unit tests and integration tests are currently failing. Instead of running tests to validate fixes, do a thorough code review of the changes and static analysis
