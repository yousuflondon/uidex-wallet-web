# Installation Guide for Uidex Wallet Web App, Android App and Desktop App 

For high level understanding of Uidex Wallet code base, please checkout Komodo developer guide on README front page.

Uidex Wallet pretty much preserved all the features in the open sourced Gleec Wallet (formerly Komodo Wallet) app, with DEX enabled and some logo/name changes.

## Hardware Requirement - proper hardware for PC, chromebook, or mobile phones

The uidex web app was successfully tested in google chrome or firefox browser on multiple platforms: windows 11, macOS, linux, chromebook, android phone.

The uidex desktop app released binary files were tested successfully in Windows 11 and linux (ubuntu 24.04) on x64 hardware. 

The uidex android apk released file was successfully tested with google Nexus 9 pro and Samsung model phones.

## Dependency Requirement for web/android/linux wallet - flutter and android-studio
Uidex Web/Android/linux Wallet app is flutter based app.  You can compile your own linux binary files, android apk, or compile and run self-hosted web app in Ubuntu 22.04 easily by meeting flutter and android-studio 
requirement below. Check out Komodo Developer Guide on README for details.
- Install latest version of android studio.  For easily navigate and install proper features of android-studio, a x-windows GUI on Ubuntu is recommended.
- Install flutter on proper version under your home directory.  Too new or too old version of flutter won't compile this release.

Finally, check dependency with below command:
```commandline
  flutter doctor -v
```

ShorelineCrypto production web/android app was compiled successfully under below dependency versions in Ubuntu 22.04:

## Uidex Wallet Web App
### Step 1 - compile uidex-wallet web app

To compile your self-hosted web app, run below

```
  git clone https://github.com/yousuflondon/uidex-wallet-web.git
  cd uidex-wallet-web && git checkout uidex
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  flutter build web --csp --no-web-resources-cdn
```

If above command runs successfully, it will say that coins has been updated, please re-compile web app again. Now re-compile:

```
  flutter build web --csp --no-web-resources-cdn
```

Now you should see the notice that web app has been compiled successfully at terminal. 

### Step 2 - Run Web App

run below:
```
  flutter run -d  web-server  --web-hostname  localhost --web-port=8888  --release
```

Now Uidex Web Wallet should be running at "http://localhost:8888" web URL.  This web URL can only be accessed from same host machine that web app runs on. 

### Step 3 - Set up https with certbot/nginx

The new web version of Komodo Wallet imposed security enhancement feature that can only run through localhost host. Uidex Web Wallet removed geo blocker restriction of komodo web wallet, however, this localhost restriction stays.

The setup of https redirection to full host name with certbot/nginx can follow similar method of electrumx WSS/SSL setup as in https://komodoplatform.com/en/docs/komodo/setup-electrumx-server/ 

For example, using Ubuntu 20.04 and NGINX:

```
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo apt-get remove certbot
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Will create a cert file and key file, and update your nginx `sites-enabled` config.

## Uidex Wallet Android App
### Step 1 - compile uidex-wallet android app

There are 3 ways to compile android apk installation file: github action CI/CD method, docker method and flutter build method. Here android apk release was obtained through flutter method.

To compile your own android app apk file, make sure your linux server (ubuntu 22.04) met the flutter/android studio dependency as shown above, then run below

```
  git clone https://github.com/yousuflondon/uidex-wallet-web.git
  cd uidex-wallet-web && git checkout uidex
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  dart run flutter_launcher_icons
  flutter build apk
```

If above command runs successfully, it may say that coins has been updated, please re-compile android app again. Now re-compile:

```commandline
    flutter build apk
```

Now your android apk files will be built successfully under 'build' folder.  Transfer apk file into your android phone/pad,  install and run the android app for Uidex Wallet.

### Step 2 - Trouble shoot Icon/Logo Failure

If step 1 failed with message like "duplicate error on color.xml bla bla", or the new icon/logo in your local branch does not show up fresh, you can clear graddle/kotlin cache with below command:

```commandline
  cd android/
  ./gradlew clean
  cd ..
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  dart run flutter_launcher_icons
  flutter build apk
```

## Uidex Wallet Linux Desktop App
### Step 1 - compile uidex-wallet Desktop Linux app

There are 3 ways to compile linux desktop binary file: github action CI/CD method, docker method and flutter build method. Here linux release was obtained through flutter method.

To compile your own linux release files, make sure your linux server (ubuntu 22.04) met the flutter/linux dependency as shown above, then run below

```
  git clone https://github.com/yousuflondon/uidex-wallet-web.git
  cd uidex-wallet-web && git checkout uidex
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  flutter build linux
```

If above command runs successfully, it may say that coins has been updated and crash, please re-compile linux app again. Now re-compile:

```commandline
    flutter build linux
```

Now your linux binary release files will be built successfully under 'build/linux/x64/release/bundle' folder.  Rename this `bundle` folder name into proper linux folder with version, then move the whole folder into desired installation location such as below:

```commandline
mv build/linux/x64/release/bundle ~/uidex-wallet_linux_unified_0.9.3.2

```

### Step 2 - Trouble shoot Linux Failure on kdf

You can launch the linux app from Linux Desktop by double clicking the binary file directly.  However, it is known that if you symbolic link the binary file into other location such as Desktop, an error of "kdf not found" will show up. 

You can also launch the linux wallet app on terminal with all the log printing out in details on terminal as below:
```commandline
  cd ~/uidex-wallet_linux_unified_0.9.3.2
  ./UidexWallet &
  
```
## Uidex Wallet Windows Desktop App
### Step 1 - fork uidex-wallet-web repo

Windows 11 release was obtained through github action CI/CD method. This repo source code allows you to perform the same binary file release yourself from source code.

To obtain do-it-yourself your own binary compiled installation file for windows 11 desktop app from source code, you will need to fork this github repo first, then in your own forked repo, enable github action. Github action is free service provided by github for every github account. 


### Step 2 - PR to uidex branch to compile

This source code under '.github' subfolder has all the code for github action CI/CD compiling method. The compiling will be triggered upon "pull request" to the default `uidex` git branch. Try to play with your branch code and PR to uidex branch to enable github Actions to compile windows desktp app binary release. The final compiled result file is at:
git Actions -> Building desktop apps -> Build desktop (windows) -> Upload artifact
