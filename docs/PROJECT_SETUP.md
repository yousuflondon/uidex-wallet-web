# Project setup

Uidex Wallet is a cross-platform application, meaning it can be built for multiple target platforms using the same code base. It is important to note that some target platforms may only be accessible from specific host platforms. Below is a list of all supported host platforms and their corresponding target platforms:

| Host Platform | Target Platform                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| macOS         | Web, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Android |
| Windows       | Web, Windows, Android            |
| Linux         | Web, Linux, Android              |

## Host Platform Setup

 1. [Install Flutter, pin Flutter version](INSTALL_FLUTTER.md)
 2. Install IDEs
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
      - Install and enable `Dart` and `Flutter` extensions
      - Enable `Dart: Use recommended settings` via the Command Palette
    - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
      - Install and enable `Dart` and `Flutter` plugins
      - Ensure that the following tools are installed and updated in SDK Manager -> SDK Tools:
        - Android SDK Build-Tools
        - NDK (Side by side)
        - Android command line tools
        - CMake
    - (macOS only) [xCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
    - (Windows only) [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
      - `Desktop development with C++` workload required
      - [Nuget CLI](https://www.nuget.org/downloads) required for Windows desktop builds
      - [Enable long paths in Windows registry](BUILD_RUN_APP.md#windows-desktop)
 3. (macOS only) CocoaPods and Ruby setup:
    - Ruby: 3.0+ (recommended: 3.4.x). See [Ruby setup](BUILD_RUN_APP.md#ruby-setup).
    - CocoaPods: 1.15+ (assuming latest Xcode). See [CocoaPods installation](BUILD_RUN_APP.md#cocoapods-installation).
 4. Run `flutter doctor` and make sure all checks (except version) pass
 5. [Clone project repository](CLONE_REPOSITORY.md)
 6. **Initialize SDK submodule**: After cloning, initialize the komodo-defi-sdk-flutter submodule:

    cd komodo-wallet
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

 7. Build and run the App for each target platform:

## Possible Issues

### GitHub API 403 rate limit exceeded

If you get a 403 error when trying to build or run your app, it is likely that you have hit the [GitHub API rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). You can either wait for some time or create and add a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to your environment variables.

NOTE: The name of the environment variable should be `GITHUB_API_PUBLIC_READONLY_TOKEN`.

```bash
export GITHUB_API_PUBLIC_READONLY_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
```

Example of the 403 error message (more likely after multiple repeated builds):

```bash
test@test komodo-wallet % flutter build web

Expected to find fonts for (MaterialIcons, packages/komodo_ui_kit/Custom, packages/cupertino_icons/CupertinoIcons), but found (MaterialIcons, packages/komodo_ui_kit/Custom). This usually means you are referring to font families in an IconData class but not including them in the assets section of your pubspec.yaml, are missing the package that would include
them, or are missing "uses-material-design: true".
Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 13640 bytes (99.2% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
