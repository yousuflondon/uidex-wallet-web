## Prompt Content

I want to write comprehensive release notes for Uidex Wallet **{VERSION_NUMBER}**.

For reference, here are the previous release notes to match their structure and style:

**{PREVIOUS_RELEASE_NOTES}**

Below is the changelog for Uidex Wallet **{VERSION_NUMBER}**. Please help me organize and format this information into proper release notes. Not everything from the changelog needs to be included - focus on significant features, enhancements, fixes, and breaking changes similar to how previous release notes were structured:

**{CHANGELOG_CONTENT}**

Here are the commits with authors to help you properly attribute changes:

**{COMMITS_WITH_AUTHORS}**

Please create release notes with the following sections:

1. A brief introduction highlighting the most significant changes
2. New Features (with PR links and authors)
3. UI/UX Improvements (with PR links and authors)

Structure the release notes similarly to Uidex Wallet **{REFERENCE_VERSION}** format, but you can take inspiration from other previous releases as well. Use expandable details sections for longer lists where appropriate. Make the notes informative but concise, highlighting the most important changes first.

For multiplatform changes, please indicate which platforms (Web, Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS) are affected by each change.

If any information is missing or unclear, please ask before completing the release notes.
